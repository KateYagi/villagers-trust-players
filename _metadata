  "description" : "Villagers Trust Players\n\nInspired by Lazy Guards by Reika (Which as of right now is broken, as it has not been updated in a few years.)\n\nStarbound mod that makes villager NPCs not care if you break their stuff. Why? I dunno. Maybe they think if you're a protectorate that you probably need that item for something important, or maybe you just have Stealth 100 and they don't notice you just broke their door.\n\nI made this because I saw a critter fall in a pond, and wanted to make a way for it to crawl out, and got shot at for \"stealing\" dirt.\n\nPatches out accuse and attackThief from behaviors/npc/villager.behavior, and villagerguard.behavior.\n\n.pak file available on github: https://github.com/KateYagi/villagers-trust-players \n\nTo see other mods I've made, check out my neocities: https://kateyagi.neocities.org/mods.html",
