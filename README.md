# Villagers Trust Players

Inspired by Lazy Guards by Reika (Which as of right now is broken, as it has not been updated in a few years.)

Starbound mod that makes villager NPCs not care if you break their stuff. Why? I dunno. Maybe they think if you're a protectorate that you probably need that item for something important, or maybe you just have Stealth 100 and they don't notice you just broke their door.

I made this because I saw a critter fall in a pond, and wanted to make a way for it to crawl out, and got shot at for 'stealing' dirt.

Patches out accuse and attackThief from behaviors/npc/villager.behavior, and villagerguard.behavior.

A .pak is provided in the releases.
